## About

This is an end-to-end application with both front-end and [back-end](https://github.com/denilsonbaptista/food-explorer-api), simulating the process of ordering and registering a restaurant.

Food Explorer has two roles: the admin and the user.

The admin is the person responsible for the restaurant and can create, view, edit, and delete a dish at any time.

The user can view all registered dishes and, when clicking on a dish, will be redirected to a new screen with more detailed information about it.

Admin user access: <br />
username: admin@email.com <br />
password: 123 <br />

User access: <br />
username: user@email.com <br />
password: 123 <br />
